Sometimes you need a break from the standard every day beef burgers!

Mark Bittman's [Kitchen Matrix](http://amzn.to/2nb5Q4D) is the perfect "guideline" book.  Bittman gives you tons of ideas for all kinds of ingredients.

Today I was craving salmon so I opened to that section which is further categorized as Raw, Poached, Grilled or Burgers.  I went with the Mustard and Shallots variation of the burger.  I ended up topping it with lettuce, cucumbers, red onion and more Dijon mustard.  Without the mustard it was a little plain.  I swear the picture in the book has white sauce sticking out of the bottom, but the recipe doesn't talk about it at all.  The other two variations have a sauce - yogurt to go on the curried burger and salsa for a spicier version.

Looking around online, I stumbled across his recipe on [Diner's Journal](https://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/06/recipe-of-the-day-salmon-burgers/) which has even more suggestions:

>* Use a combination of soy sauce (about a tablespoon), sesame oil (a teaspoon) and ginger (a teaspoon). Use peanut oil for sauteeing if you have it.
>* Add a small clove of garlic (don\'t overdo it, because the garlic will remain nearly raw and strong tasting).
>
> For the coarser, second batch, you can:
>* Use a quarter of a cup onion or scallions, in addition to or instead of the shallots.
>* Add spice mixtures like curry or chili powder, using a teaspoon to a tablespoon, depending on your spice capacity.
>* Add 1 tablespoon or more of fresh herbs, like parsley, chervil, dill or cilantro.
>* Add red or yellow bell pepper (half a cup), cored, seeded and roughly chopped.

Once you've settled on mix-ins and toppings (hmm, now I want a sundae) it's time to assemble!

Spread the sauce on top and add the freshly seared patty.

![Mustard and Shallot Salmon Burger with cucumbers -- Recipes Are Just Guidelines](/public/images/salmon burgers/Salmon Burgers Cucumbers.jpg)

Then add lettuce, onion, cucumbers, or whatever else you happen to have in your fridge that sounds good.

## Mustard and Shallot Salmon Burgers

### INGREDIENTS
* 1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless salmon
* 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
* 2 shallots, peeled and cut into chunks
* ½ cup coarse bread crumbs
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 2 tablespoons butter or olive oil

#### Toppings
* Lettuce
* Red Onion
* Cucumbers
* Avocado
* Tomatoes

#### Optional sauce
* Dijon mustard
* Mayo
* Sriracha

### Directions:
1. Cut **salmon** into large chunks
2. Put one-fourth of it in a food processor with **Dijon mustard**.  Process into a paste.

4. Stir in **bread crumbs**
5. Shape into 4 burgers; refrigerate for up to a few hours.
6. Heat a butter or olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat (or turn on the grill, but these are fragile so be careful if grilling!)
7. Season the salmon patties with salt and pepper
8. Once the skillet or grill is nice and hot, cook the patties until firm - about 4 minutes on one side and then a couple minutes on the other side
9. Meanwhile, mix together the sauce.  Scoop in a spoonful of **mayo**, some **mustard** and a few squirts of **Sriracha**.  Stir it all up!
10. Assemble with your favorite toppings - lettuce, sliced red onion, cucumber slices, avocado/guacamole, tomato
