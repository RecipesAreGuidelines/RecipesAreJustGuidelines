Sometimes you need a break from the standard every day beef burgers!

Mark Bittman's Kitchen Matrix is the perfect "guideline" book.  Mark Bittman gives you tons of ideas for all kinds of ingredients.  Today I was craving salmon so I opened to that section which is further categorized as Raw, Poached, Grilled or Burgers.  I went with the Mustard and Shallots variation of the burger.  I ended up topping it with lettuce, cucumbers, red onion and more Dijon mustard.  Without the mustard it was a little plain.  I swear the picture in the book has white sauce sticking out of the bottom, but the recipe doesn't talk about it at all.  The other two variations have a sauce - yogurt to go on the curried burger and salsa for a spicier version.

Have you ever tried a salmon burger?


## Mustard and Shallot Salmon Burgers

### INGREDIENTS
* 1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless salmon
* 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
* 2 shallots, peeled and cut into chunks
* ½ cup coarse bread crumbs
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 2 tablespoons butter or olive oil

#### Toppings
* Lettuce
* Red Onion
* Cucumbers
* Avocado
* Tomatoes

#### Optional sauce
* Dijon mustard
* Mayo
* Sriracha

### Directions:
1. Cut **salmon** into large chunks
2. Put one-fourth of it in a food processor with **Dijon mustard**.  Process into a paste.
3. Add the remaining **salmon** and chopped **shallot**; pulse to roughly chop the salmon
4. Stir in **bread crumbs**
5. Shape into 4 burgers; refrigerate for up to a few hours.
6. Heat a butter or olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat (or turn on the grill, but these are fragile so be careful if grilling!)
7. Season the salmon patties with salt and pepper
8. Once the skillet or grill is nice and hot, cook the patties until firm - about 4 minutes on one side and then a couple minutes on the other side
9. Meanwhile, mix together the sauce.  Scoop in a spoonful of **mayo**, some **mustard** and a few squirts of **Sriracha**.  Stir it all up!
10. Assemble with your favorite toppings - lettuce, sliced red onion, cucumber slices, avocado/guacamole, tomato
