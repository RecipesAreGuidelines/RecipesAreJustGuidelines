Here's my obligatory first post!

I'm excited to be starting a new blog to share my love of food with all of you.<!--more-->  As the name suggests - I truly believe that recipes are just a guideline to help you with your unique food experience.  Everyone has different tastes, likes, dislikes, dietary restrictions, access to ingredients, equipment in their kitchen, etc. so you have to be able to tweak a recipe to fit your needs and I'd like to help you do that.

I'm also an avid cookbook reader.  I'm constantly adding new books to my collection and pretty much have at least 3 checked out from the library at all times.  I often find that even the most polished cookbooks have recipes that have confusing instructions or call for unusual/expensive ingredients or suggest time consuming methods.  I plan on making recipes from these books as a normal home cook would and let you know my experiences.  Even if my experiments fail horribly, I will write about it so you can learn from my mistakes!

Anything related to gardening, food TV shows, camping or eating out are all fair game here too.  So I hope you have fun in sharing some of my adventures!
