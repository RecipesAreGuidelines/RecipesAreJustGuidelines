Hi there, and welcome to Recipes Are Just Guidelines!  

My name is Amanda and I have a passion for food.  I like cooking it, baking it, grilling it and of course eating it.  But I also love growing my own herbs and vegetables, watching anything related to food on TV and my bedside table is piled high with cookbooks and cooking magazines.

I created this blog to share my passion and experiences with others.  

If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to email me at <{{ site.email }}>!
