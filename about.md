Welcome to Recipes Are Just Guidelines!

As the name suggests - I truly believe that recipes are just a guideline to help you with your unique food experience.  Everyone has different tastes, likes, dislikes, dietary restrictions, access to ingredients, equipment in their kitchen, etc. so you have to be able to tweak a recipe to fit your needs and I'd like to help you do that.
